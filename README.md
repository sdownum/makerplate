# Makerplate

This is a project for a Arduino (or Atmel AVR) based programmable electronic nameplate to proudly hang in your office or cubicle.

Currently supports character displays using the Adafruit i2c/SPI LCD Backpack, over i2c.

Requires the Adafruit Liquid Crystal library, found here:

Yes, I already know I need to rename the project. It's a place holder for sure.
